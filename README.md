# TER-automata-to-regular-language

Implementation in C++ of an 'automata to regular expression' algorithm with a QT interface. It aim to be both easy to use and fast.

The program accept files from other software as an input such as Supremica and display the farious informations contained within it to review or modify before creating a regular expression assossiated with it.

WIP.
